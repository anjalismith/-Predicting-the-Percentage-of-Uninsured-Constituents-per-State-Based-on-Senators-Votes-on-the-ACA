## Predicting the Percentage of Uninsured Constituents per State Based on Senatorsâ€™ Votes on the ACA
### Performed a cross-sectional analysis of the 2011 BRFSS Health Care Access/Coverage data published by the CDC.
### Fitted a linear model to the data using the lm function in R to analyze the correlation between the 2009 voting decisions of senators on the Affordable Care Act and the percentage of their constitutions that were uninsured in 2011.
### Calculated a slope of -1.4210 & constant of 17.9968; there is a significant statistical difference between the percentage of uninsured constituents in states whose senators both support the ACA and states in which both senators opposed its passage.
